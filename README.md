## About me

I'm a goal-oriented individual with 5 years experience in a customer-centric retail environment and a diverse skillset from a variety of personal and professional experiences. In the last five years, I've worked as a retail assistant, receptionist and group fitness instructor. I also trained in martial arts challenging my physical fitness and perfectionistic mindset.

In my journey so far, I have learned to value progress over perfection. Learning fosters growth and mistakes are not something to be afraid of as they provide the foundation to learn and better ourselves. Programming is no different. Progress over perfection.
